## SPI Overview (Context For The Project)

SPI uses four signals to connect a bus controller (master) to peripherals:

- **MISO** -- Master In, Slave Out (data from peripheral to controller)
- **MOSI** -- Master Out, Slave In (data from controller to peripheral)
- **SCK** -- Serial Clock generated by the controller
- **CS** -- Chip Select (one per peripheral, active low)

In this project, the Arduino Uno is used to control the SPI bus, and the TMP121 acts as a peripeheral device. 

## TMP121 Notes

The TMP121 is a **read-only** temperature sensor and does not include a Serial Input (SI) pin. 
Therefore:

- The **MOSI line isn't needed so it's disconnected
- Only **MISO, SCK, and CS** are used in communication
- Temperature data is clocked out of it while CS is low.
